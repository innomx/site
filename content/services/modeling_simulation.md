This is the crux of what we do: population PK, PK/PD and exposure-response
modeling. A good population PK model is a cornerstone for understanding your
drug's exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety profile. Once a model has been
estblished, simulations are an invaluable tool for making predictions (what-if
scenarios), designing new trial, and optimizing dosing in special populations
like pediatrics.
